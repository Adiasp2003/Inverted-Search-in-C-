Inverted search is a method used to search words efficiently in multiple files.
It creates an index where each word is linked to the files containing it.
Each word also stores how many times it appears in each file.
This index allows fast searching without scanning all files again.
The database is created by reading input text files.
Words are stored using data structures like hashing and linked lists.
The database can be displayed, saved, and updated from a backup.
Searching a word gives the list of files and frequencies.
It reduces time and improves performance for large data sets.
It is widely used in search engines and document search systems.
